# CodeVec

**CodeVec** is a hackathon project that brings intelligent code understanding to life using natural language queries.

It functions like a real-time CodeLLM assistant: you can ask questions about your codebase, and it responds based on the actual code contextâ€”no need for manual prompt engineering. Just write code, ask, and get answers.

- Understands your code with context-aware LLMs  
- Query using natural language  
- Supports full projects  
- Powered by Ollama-hosted models  
- Real-time backend interaction  

**1st Runner-Up** at the hackathon where it was built.

> Built to explore smarter code interaction through LLMs.
